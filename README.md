# Sudoku-Web-Solver
First repository different from hello world and TicTacToe also serving as training (for me) to create repositories. This is a little project I did after reading, that a Sudoku solver is a good example for a **back tracking algorithm**. When the algorithm was ready, I found it a bit tedious to look up and enter new puzzles manually all the time, so I searched for a free sudoku puzzle website and used **selenium** to read in the puzzle, using my code to solve the puzzle and then selenium again to put in the solution. At the time of posting I wasn't sure, whether I was allowed to show the link to a website, which I have no affiliation to, so it is not shown in the code.
