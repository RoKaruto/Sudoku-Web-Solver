# Sudoku-Web-Solver
First repository different from hello world also serving as a test (for me) how to create repositories. This is a little project I did after reading, that a Sudoku solver is a good example for a quick **back tracking algorithm**. When the algorithm was ready, I found it a bit tedious to look up and enter new puzzles manually all the time, so I searched for a free sudoku puzzle website and used **selenium** to read in the puzzle and put in the solution. At the time of posting I wasn't sure, whether I was allowed to show the link in my repositories having no affiliation to, so it is not shown in the code.
