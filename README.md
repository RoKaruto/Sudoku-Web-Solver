# Sudoku-Web-Solver
First repository different from hello world also serving as a test (for me) how to create repositories. This is a little project I did on a Saturday afternoon after I read, that a Sudoku solver is a good example for a quick back tracking algorithm. When the algorithm was ready, I found it a bit tedious to look up and enter new puzzles manually all the time, so I looked up a free sudoku puzzle website and used selenium to read in the puzzle and put in the solution. At the time of posting I wasn't sure, whether I was allowed to show the link to a website, which I have no affiliation to, so it is not shown in the code.
